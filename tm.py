        **What is Time Series Analysis?**
        
        Time series analysis involves analyzing data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. It is used to understand the underlying patterns in data that are indexed in time order.

        **Why Use Time Series Analysis?**

        Time series analysis is used to:
        - Forecast future values based on historical data.
        - Identify trends and seasonal patterns.
        - Understand the impact of different variables on the time series.
        - Detect anomalies and irregularities in the data.
        
        **Main Characteristics of Time Series Data:**

        1. **Trend:** The long-term movement or direction in the data over time.
        2. **Seasonality:** Regular, repeating patterns or cycles in the data at consistent intervals.
        3. **Cyclic Patterns:** Fluctuations that occur in cycles but not necessarily at fixed intervals, often influenced by economic or business conditions.
        4. **Irregularity (Noise):** Random variations in the data that cannot be attributed to trend, seasonality, or cyclic patterns.
        5. **Stationarity:** When a time seriesâ€™ statistical properties like mean and variance are constant over time.
        6. **Autocorrelation:** The correlation of a time series with its own lagged values, measuring how values are related to past values.
        7. **Mean Reversion:** The tendency of a time series to revert to its long-term mean over time.
        8. **Volatility:** The degree of variation or dispersion in the data, indicating stability or fluctuations.

        **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF):**
        
        The Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) measures the correlation between a time series and its lagged values while controlling for the values of the time series at intermediate lags. It helps identify the direct effect of past observations on the current value and is useful in determining the order of autoregressive models.
